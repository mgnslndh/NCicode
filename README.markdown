=======

NCicode is a .NET parser library for the Cicode programming language written in C# 

The goal of this project is to create a complete parser for the Cicode programming language that can be used as a component for building Cicode tools.

Cicode
------

>Cicode is a programming language used by [Citect SCADA][1] software. The structure and syntax of Cicode is very similar to that of the Pascal programming language, the main difference being that it does not include pointers and associated concepts. Citect provides a rich programming API that includes sophisticated programming constructs such as concurrent tasks and semaphores.
>A Cicode sample is shown below. The function is used to log information to a file.
