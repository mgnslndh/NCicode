NCicode
=======

NCicode is a parser library for the Cicode programming language. 

The reason I am working on this parser is to be able to use it as a component for future projects that I have ideas for.

Cicode
------

>Cicode is a programming language used by [Citect SCADA][1] software. The structure and syntax of Cicode is very similar to that of the Pascal programming language, the main difference being that it does not include pointers and associated concepts. Citect provides a rich programming API that includes sophisticated programming constructs such as concurrent tasks and semaphores.
>A Cicode sample is shown below. The function is used to log information to a file.
